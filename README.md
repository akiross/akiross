### Hello here ğŸ‘‹ğŸŒš

<!--
Hey! I'm Alessandro (pron. he/his), currently CTO in a pretty cool tech startup called D/Vision Lab.

I'm usually a fun guy you can joke with, but I'm also pretty serious when it comes to work and computers.

I don't have *a* hobby: I like doing different things of different nature (sports, arts, crafts) and I like to keep it that way.

Being CTO in a small company means I get to do many interesting and very technical things, such as:

- cleaning toilets (CTO means Cleaning Toilets Officer... Right? RIGHT??)
- mopping floors
- keeping the kitchen functioning and *especially* the coffee virtual machine
- maintaining and automating internal infrastructure
- evaluating new tools, programming languages and development procedures
- assessing the quality of our work and improving on it
- developing and engineering new software, from concept to production
- managing the internal R&D efforts
- helping people to be happy, learn new skills and be more productive

(Some of these might actually not part of my work.)

Other things you might be interested in:

- I'm a very happy neovim user!
  - But I'm curious about helix and I'd like to see how it would work in the long term.
- I'm a very happy GNU/Linux user (I spent significant amount of time using the commands `emerge`, then `yum`/`dnf` and since 2020 `nix`)!
- I've been using Rust since 2019; it is the language I like the most.
- I've been using Python for a long time, since python 2.6; it is the language I use the most.
- I've been using Elm for front-end since a couple of years and, man, it's great. I'm also keeping an eye on gren-lang, roc-lang and gleam.
  - Elm, with Rust and Nix, contributed pushing me towards functional languages.
- I'm generally quick at picking up new languages and over the years I've delivered software in Python, Rust, Go, Dart/Flutter, JavaScript, Java, C, C++, Ruby, PHP (maybe more?).
- I do like open source, but I'm actually very shy when it come to sharing my work so 98% of my code is not public, as this content is public *but hidden in a comment*. I'm working on that.
- Topics I enjoy a lot are: Programming Languages, Computer Graphics and Artificial Intelligence.
- Whenever possible, I push my new code on https://codeberg.org/akiross but I didn't set up a mirror with GH yet.

Also, I'm a nerd.
